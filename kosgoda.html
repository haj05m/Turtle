 <center><p class="w3-opacity" style="text-align: center"><strong>The first turtle hatchery in Sri Lanka was established here in 1978 by Dr. R. S. B. Wickremesinghe 
 and Dr. Upen de Silva. All five of the country's species can be found making their nests at Kosgoda, one of the relatively few hatcheries. They are the Hawksbill, Leatherback, Green, Loggerheads, and Olive Ridley turtles. </strong></p></center>
 

 <p>One of 18 turtle hatcheries along Sri Lanka's southern coast is the Turtle Care Center at Kosgoda Beach. The center was founded in 1981 and is situated in the beach community of Kosgoda. Additionally, Kosgoda serves as the nesting ground for all five species of turtles that come to Sri Lanka. This is not the case with many of the other island-area hatcheries, where just some of the species are present on the beaches.
The facility primarily serves as a hatchery and makes great efforts to boost the rate of hatching and survival of young turtles. However, the Care Center also treats and releases sick or injured persons back into the ocean after treating them. </p>

 <h2><u>The hatchery works in the following steps:</u></h2>
 <ul>
 <li>The staff searches the beach at night for female sea turtles that emerge from the water to lay eggs.</li>
 <li>Until the mother has finished laying the eggs and has returned to the ocean, they guard the mother from a distance while she is in the nesting stage.</li>
 <li>To keep the eggs safe from predators and careless human behavior, the eggs are moved from the beach to the hatchery.</li>
 <li>Fishermen are additionally compensated for bringing any turtle eggs they locate to the hatchery.</li>
 <li>In a safe environment, the eggs grow and hatch. It can take 45 to 60 days to complete.</li>
 <li>If there are no issues, the newly hatched turtles are released into the water that same day. This is done in an effort to limit human influence on their way of life as much as possible.</li>
 </ul>

 <h2 style="color:DarkSlateGray;"><u>History</u></h2>
 <p>Dudley Perera founded the Kosgoda Sea Turtle Conservation Project to preserve sea turtles and guard them against crabs, dogs, and other predators. One of the 18 hatcheries in Sri Lanka dedicated to the correct reproduction of this endangered species is Kosgoda, which was founded in the 1980s. The protection and rehabilitation of sea turtles in the water is the main objective of the numerous volunteers working on this initiative today.In order to ensure that any mother turtles have suitable conditions to lay eggs, the volunteers patrol the beach at night. They also transport the eggs back to the hatchery to ensure proper hatching without predator injury, and once fully hatched, they release the young sea turtles back into the ocean.
 <br><br>Kosgoda is well-known for its beaches, Kosgoda River, and traditional fishing industry in addition to its turtle hatcheries. There are several hotels, villas, and little guesthouses in the town.

The production of goods made from coconut and cinnamon, tourism, and fishing all contribute significantly to the local economy. Numerous small-scale enterprises that manufacture coconut oil, coconut fiber, and other items are located in the town. Buddhist worship has been practiced at Kosgoda for a very long time, and there are many old temples and holy places there. The Kosgoda Raja Maha Viharaya, a Buddhist temple from the 16th century, is the most prominent of these.</br></br></p>
 
<h2 style="color:DarkSlateGray;"><u>The Kosgoda Turtle Hatchery's Activities & Hatching Procedure.</u></h2>
<p>The Kosgoda Turtle Hatchery is situated in a seaside community with a tranquil ambience for beach vacationers on Sri Lanka's southwestern coast. The distance between the village and Colombo city is about 70 kilometers. It's not difficult to travel here by car. 
Whether you choose to go by bus or drive your own car, you may reach the turtle hatchery in less than two hours using the Colombo-Galle A2 or E01 Southern Express highways.<br><br>By raising hatching rates, Kosgoda Turtle Hatchery continues to pursue its steadfast objective of protecting sea turtle eggs. In addition to merely hatching, they also take care of fishing-related turtles that are frail, injured, or paralyzed. The volunteers patrol the shoreline at night in search of turtles that are about to lay eggs. The volunteers transport the eggs from the beach to the hatchery once the mother turtles have finished laying their eggs. The development and hatching of the eggs could take 45 to 60 days. Baby turtles are swiftly released back into the water after hatching, usually in the late evenings to lessen bird and crab predation.</br></br></p>

<h2 style="color:DarkSlateGray;"><u>Volunteering at the Kosgoda Hatchery.</u></h2>
<p>For everyone in the area or a visitor with an interest in nature and learning about turtle habitats, Kosgoda Turtle Hatchery offers an engaging pastime. Here, you can have projects of your own ideas, both short-term and long-term. They can help you with the greatest selections and ideas if you let them know before you arrive. The majority of the time, visitors merely join in on routine tasks like looking for eggs, transporting them to the hatchery, tending to the injured, feeding them, and preserving the habitats. It can offer you lodging, meals, and a variety of leisure activities like excursions and water sports for a fee. If you plan to participate in the Kosgoda project, it is best to perform some internet research about the mission prior to have simple strategies to get around the turtle issues.</p>
