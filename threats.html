<center><h1>Threats to Turtles</h1></center>
<center><p class="w3-opacity"><strong>By preserving vegetation and promoting the health of coral reefs, sea turtles contribute to the sustainability of the ocean ecosystems. However, extinction threats are currently posed to these magnificent creatures. In the ocean and close to commercial fisheries, many turtles become ensnared in fishing nets. Climate change, egg harvesting, and the loss of nesting sites are further challenges brought on by humans.</strong></p></center>
<center><p style="text-align: center;">These threats can lead to a <strong><u>decline in turtle populations</u></strong> and have severe impacts on the marine ecosystem. While conservation efforts are being made to protect turtle populations, it is crucial to continue to raise awareness and take measures to address these threats and ensure the long-term survival of these important and iconic species.</p></center>

<center><h4>Threats:</h4></center>
<strong><u><li>Pollution</li></u></strong>
<p>When solid waste, chemicals, and other pollutants from human activity enter the ocean, they harm sea turtles and can even kill them. The sources of contamination include everything from fertilizer runoff from farms to fishing nets lost by fisherman to wastewater discharge from cruise liners. The maritime environment is contaminated by thousands of chemicals, many of which build up in sea turtle tissues and impair their ability to move, think, and reproduce. Additionally, plastics and other marine debris are consumed by sea turtles, harming their digestive systems. The incidence and spread of fibropapillomatosis, a disease in sea turtles that causes tumors to grow on the eyes, intestinal tracts, lungs, mouth, heart, and other organs, are thought to be related to exposure to agricultural pollution, according to scientists.
<br><br>Due to their regular rising to the surface and inability to breathe underwater, sea turtles frequently come into contact with vessels. Particularly in shipping channels and during the busiest travel seasons, when millions of recreational boaters gather in coastal areas, commercial and recreational watercraft pose a serious threat to turtles.
 One of the most documented causes of trauma for turtles is boat crashes. Flipper amputations, shell fractures, brain traumas, and broken bones are among the injuries caused by boat propellers. Even though not all of these wounds result in instant death, they may cause severe stress or other wounds that ultimately impair a sea turtle's capacity to hunt, migrate, flee from predators, and reproduce.</br></br>
 What Can You Do to Preserve the Habitat of Sea Turtles? Reduce marine debris that could trap or unintentionally ingest sea turtles. To keep our beaches and ocean clean, take part in coastal cleanups and cut back on plastic consumption. Sea turtles and other marine life can be harmed by trash in the water.</p>
<center><img src="images/threats turtles4.jpg" alt="" width="690" height="450"></center>
<strong><u><li>Direct Take</li></u></strong>
<p>Turtles are murdered all over the world and sold as unusual food, oil, leather, and jewelry on the international market. Millions of hawkbill turtles alone have been slaughtered over the past century only for the value of their shells. Even though efforts to promote conservation have resulted in a decline in the global trade in luxury and handicrafts, turtles continue to face danger in some regions of Africa, Asia, and the Americas.
<br><br>For thousands of years, sea turtles have been taken from the wider Caribbean region. The earliest written history of the area and archeological sites both contain evidence of use and trade. The majority of sea turtle parts have potential domestic or commercial value. For example, the shell can be carved into fish hooks and used as jewelry. The flipper and neck skin can be tanned and used to make leather goods. The meat and eggs are consumed. The offal, calipee, and bones are used to make turtle soup. The oil is used as a lubricant, a base for cosmetics, and as a medicine. As stuffed animals, turtles are also used.
Sea turtles being taken directly is nothing new. Sea turtles have been used as food for thousands of years by both governmental elites and indigenous peoples alike for their meat, eggs, and shells. However, it wasn't until the 1800s that the global sea turtle trade grew significant enough to pose a threat to some species' extinction.  <a href="https://www.tooraretowear.org/how-to-recognize-turtleshell">Learn how to recognize items made from tortoiseshell when traveling</a>, so be sure to avoid anything made of tortoiseshell by learning how to identify it. Report any tortoiseshell items you find.

<strong><u><li>Coastal Development</li></u></strong>
 <p>Because of receding coasts, sea turtle habitats are devastated every year. Sea turtle food sources and nesting areas are severely impacted anywhere there is boat vessel traffic, anytime a new hotel or high-rise is built up along the shore, and everywhere the sea floor is dug up and the beach erodes.Around the world, growth and construction have significantly changed sea turtle nesting beaches. Many of the world's beaches have undergone extensive development, and coastal areas are regarded as prime real estate. In order to help protect their land from erosion, coastal property owners who live near beaches that are at risk of erosion frequently erect armoring structures like vertical seawalls and sloping rock revetments.
<br><br>Sand loss and upland constructions are meant to be protected by coastal armoring. Sea barriers, on the other hand, figuratively form a boundary in the sand, preventing beaches from naturally relocating inland or recovering after storm occurrences. When they come into contact with waves, they redirect the energy of the waves back onto the beach in front of or to the sides of the wall, causing more erosion and a lowering of the beach, especially right in front of the wall. Additionally, they trap sand that would typically be dumped onto an eroding beach on the landward side.
<br><br>The use of sea walls can be reduced by building farther inland, elevating structures on pilings, and placing sand (for dune or beach restoration). When building sea walls, they should be placed as far inland and away from active nesting beaches as possible. Avoid constructing armor-piercing buildings on the sand; 
 encourage coastal development setback regulations;
 Avoid stomping on dunes and grow native flora there to aid in their restoration and protection;
 Know the dynamics of the local dune and beach systems.
